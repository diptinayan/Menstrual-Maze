                <h2>A Girls’ period: what you need to know?</h2>
                <p>Have you just started your period? Or want to know what to expect?  Your period is a natural part of growing up, it is nothing to worry about – it is an important part of growing up.</p>
                <p> Your period happens once a month, and usually lasts between 2-7 days, but it may take a few months for your period to be regular and predictable, the first few may be light and irregular. You may find it useful to keep track of your period each month, to see when it is due and when it arrives. You can use an easy Period App.</p>

                <h2>Signs of getting your period</h2>
                <p> Around the time of your first period, your body shape will become curvier, your hips and breasts will get bigger. You will also notice more hair growing in new places, under your arms and around your vulva. These are all normal changes and part of growing up.</p>
             <h2>
             Your first questions
             </h2>
             <p>Your period doesn’t have to get in the way of your life. It is normal and natural, and nothing to be embarrassed or worried about. Here are some of the most common questions:</p>
             <h6>When will I get my first period?</h6>
             <p>Many girls get their period between ages 12- 14, but it can also start earlier or later.</p>
             <h6>My period just started, what should I do?</h6>
             <p>Don’t worry! Tell a parent, friend or teacher. Adults or older siblings can help you to get the right information and products that you need. You can buy a great illustrated book that explains the changes in your body. </p>
             <h6>How long will my period last?</h6>
             <p>Periods usually last between 2 – 7 days but each body is different. If your period often lasts longer than 7 days, talk to a parent or a doctor.</p>
             <h6>How much blood will I lose?</h6>
             <p>It may look like a lot, but it is only around 3-5 tablespoons. It might also be interesting to know that it’s not just blood that comes out of your vagina during your period, but also the shed uterine wall. Also, it’s quite common to find blood clots in your period, so don’t panic.</p>
             <h6>Will anyone know I am on my period?</h6>
             <p>Unless you decide to tell, it’s very unlikely anybody else will know that you are on your period. There are a few signs that might hint at the phase of the menstrual cycle you’re currently in, such as monthly pimples or period-acne, but probably nobody will notice or be keeping track apart from you. Be sure to wear a safe menstrual product, like a menstrual cup, and no one will be able to tell you’re menstruating. However, it is a good idea to ask a family or a friend for help if you feel worried. Never feel ashamed of your period.</p>
             <h6>Which product should I use?</h6>
             <p>You have a choice of products, take your time finding the right one, we explain more about products below.</p>
             <h6>Can I go swimming or play sports?</h6>
             <p>  Yes! Some menstrual products let you exercise, swim and play sports as usual. One of the products becoming more and more popular among active menstruating people are menstrual cups. </p>
